Git has three stages of workflow -1. Working aria 2. Staging aria 3. Local Repository.
We send data or code from working aria to staging aria by add command and staging aria to Local repository by 
commit command and finally send data/code from Local repo to central repo by push command.
If we run the git commit command again it will show nothing to commit, working tree clean means data has been committed.
If want to send this code to my central repository, I have to connect local repo to central repo first, for this action I 
have to create a new repository (any name) and paste the URL of git repo and execute command as given below
